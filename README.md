# Entanglement_measures

This repository has been created to store the codes of my master thesis, "Quantum Benchmarking: entanglement measurments in a quantum computer", with some examples. The codes containing two protocols for the estimation of the RÃ©nyi entropy can be found at "entanglement_measures.py", while an example of the execution can be checked at "Example_TFM.ipynb".
